# Iris-Flower-Classification
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model for the classification of Iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements. The dataset used for this task is the well-known Iris dataset, which includes features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
